# Comment-Classifier
A machine learning system which takes a comment as an input and ranks it as offensive or non-offensive (neutral). To measure its effectiveness, the following classification algorithms were used: Naive Bayes, SVM and Random Forest.

### Libraries
1. NumPy 
2. Pandas
3. scikit-learn

### Input
A data set with 6182 comments, extracted from mulitple online platforms like Youtube, Twitter etc..

### Preproccess and Text-Cleaning

### Split data (train & test)

### Train data with classification algorithms: 
1. Naive Bayes
2. SVM
3. Random Forrest

### Experimented with TF-IDF and POS

### Improvements
1. Lemmatization
2. Stopwords
3. Bigrams
4. Laplace Smoothing
